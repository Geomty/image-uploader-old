# image uploader
a random image uploader i made even though i don't have any cloud storage

## hosting
1. clone this repository (assuming you have git installed)
2. open config.json
3. replace "your password" with whatever password you want (so no one else can access your images)
4. replace "your port" with the port you want the image uploader to run on
5. open a terminal and type in `npm i` after navigating to the folder with the image uploader, then press enter (assuming you have node.js and npm installed)
6. to run the image uploader, type in `node .` and press enter
7. to view the image uploader, navigate to `http://localhost:<your port>`, with `<your port>` being replaced with what you put as the port earlier in config.json
8. images are saved in a folder called "uploads"
